### Motivation
Traditional relational databases and K/V stores couldn't quite match the complexity
of our data, and existing graph stores couldn't offer much beyond a pale API, limited
understanding of how multiâ€“dimensional graph data must be modelled. We found ourselves
constantly thinking of redundant abstractions, such as versioning, MVCC copy on write,
adâ€“hoc caches, and everything.

Instead, we realised it would be beneficial to build a distributed VM capable of doing
arbitrary computations on graphs.

The idea is that we can come up with a set of instructions that would simultaneously
be lowâ€“ and highâ€“level enough to have the necessary stuff you would otherwise have in
the virtual machine, as well as all the graphâ€“oriented stuff, usually associated with
certain nodes, edges (triplets), or subgraphs. Given the instruction set is complete,
such bytecode could be iteratively optimised, e.g. by substituting numerous lowâ€“level
computations with a couple of higherâ€“level ones. And there's plenty you can do with
graphs which you otherwise wouldn't do even if you use a graph database. Moreover,
with this bytecode we can have arbitrary Wasm and JITâ€“inserts, making integration and
bottleneck performance optimisation marginally easier. In order to construct the code,
Avtivka will offer its own assembler program.

Destined to run in a Kubernetes cluster, Avtivka will often be surrounded by the noise
of neighbouring Dgraph<sup>[[1]]</sup> and Redis<sup>[[2]]</sup> instances.
